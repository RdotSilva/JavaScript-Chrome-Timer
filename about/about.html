      The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco
      Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into
      intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
      Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato',
      after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university
      student.
